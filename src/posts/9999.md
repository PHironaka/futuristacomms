Tulip mania was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some
bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels,
and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first
recorded speculative bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto
unknown socio-economic phenomenon, than a significant economic crisis. The term
"tulip mania" is now often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble
when asset prices deviate from intrinsic values.
Tulip mania was an irrational frenzy. Everyone was involved, from chimney - sweeps to
aristocrats. A single tulip bulb sometimes traded up to 10 times a day. No one wanted
the bulbs, only the profits – it was a phenomenon of greed. Certain species of tulips
based on their rarity reached extraordinary values, specifically tulips infected with the
“breaking virus” which produced intricate lines and flame like streaks. Fortunes were
won and lost; it was the foolishness of newcomers to the market that set off the crash in
1637. The government finally stepped in and ceased the trade, but not before the
economy of Holland was ruined.
